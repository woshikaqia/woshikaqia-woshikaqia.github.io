# Welcome to woshikaqia's homepage

I am a psychometrician and social scientist specialized in measuremnt and statistics. I strive to deliver reliable and impactful educational and psychological assessments. 

I believe not a whole lot of people in my field of study use GitHub. I've recently started using GitHub and found it is a fun to be able to share ideas with a broder community. Below are a couple of projects I have been working on. Hopefully there are many more to come in the near future.

## The MIRTutils package
### Summary
The MIRTutils package is an R package that contains a set of utilty functions to help people conduct Item Reponse Theory (IRT) analyses, especially when dealing with new item types such as item bundles. It can do things such as simulate response data, compute expected items score, item residuals and item infomation, as well as model-data fit evaluation. 

For more details about functionalities and model details, use `help("MIRTutils-package")` after installation to retrieve R documentations.

### Install
```R
devtools::install("woshikaqia/MIRTutils")
```

## The NGSS psychometrics toolkit
### Summary
The NGSS psychometrics toolkit is an Shiny app I built to visualize data and results from psychometrics analyses related to work project. It was used to facilitate the operational year recap presentations to stakeholders and assessment expertises. The name NGSS came from the assessment I worked on, which is a novel assessments designed around the Next Generation Science Standards.

### Run a demo
Although this is a highly customized app for my work project, a demo can be run to get a flavor of what exactly the app actaully does
